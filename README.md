# Virtual_Mouse
This project aims to develop a software-based virtual mouse system that enables users to control their computers using hand gestures. The virtual mouse will simulate traditional mouse movements, clicks, scrolls, and other actions, providing an alternative interaction method for users with disabilities or those seeking innovative user interfaces.
