## Virtual Mouse Project Repository

### Overview:
Welcome to the official repository for our "Virtual Mouse" project! This project aims to develop a software-based virtual mouse system that enables users to control their computers using hand gestures, facial recognition, or other input methods. The virtual mouse will simulate traditional mouse movements, clicks, scrolls, and other actions, providing an alternative interaction method for users with disabilities or those seeking innovative user interfaces.

### Features:
- **Gesture Recognition**: Implement advanced algorithms to recognize hand gestures or facial expressions as input signals for controlling the virtual mouse.
- **Mouse Simulation**: Translate input signals into mouse movements, clicks, scrolls, and other actions to simulate the behavior of a physical mouse.
- **Customizable Settings**: Allow users to customize gesture mappings, sensitivity settings, and other parameters according to their preferences.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) to provide a seamless user experience across different platforms.
- **Accessibility**: Design the virtual mouse with accessibility in mind, making it easy to use for individuals with disabilities or special needs.
- **Documentation and User Guide**: Provide comprehensive documentation, installation instructions, and a user guide to help users get started with the virtual mouse system.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Continuously update and improve the virtual mouse system based on user feedback, bug reports, and technological advancements.
